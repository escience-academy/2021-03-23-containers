This workshop aims to introduce the use of Docker containers (and similar technology). Containers
can help to make you work more reproducible. Your work becomes instantly accessible to potential
users *without* going through pages of install instructions or days of compiling decade old Fortran
programs. Your work may continue to be of value decades (centuries!) into the future.
